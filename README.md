# Builder Buttons

Representational images for web design elements. Useful for crafting web design builder user interfaces, or representing content "blocks" and "widgets" anywhere useful for illustration. All images are in SVG format.

SVG files are provided unminified to preserve original markup formatting without assumption of use case and to ensure higher compatability with image editing software.

SVGs created and edited using [PenPot](https://penpot.app/), an open source application for designers and developers.
